# OBaCT — Overhead Bars + Combat Text - By Dewfonz

Relive the golden era of OG MMO's with this QOL Mod for Erenshor! 
OBaCT works with and even adds to the default combat text adding polished overhead unit frames with customizable options (F11).

##  Features

- **WoW-style combat text** Straight from the source! Which means the same comfy bold crits that *pop*  
- **Overhead bars** for HP, mana, names, and levels  
- **Dead indicators** (subtle gray + “dead” text)  
- **Configurable** via F11 in-game (sliders, toggles, themes)  
- **Suppression modes**: hide or fade bars when UI overlaps ( Fade / Occlusion will be next! )
- **Clean fonts** via Unity AssetBundle (Friz Quadrata)
